# Roadmap

There's a lot to do.
* CoAP (it's been started but not tested very well)
* User profiles
* Keep refining and improving on our use of dependencies (less > more)
* Security audits
* Better data visualizations (timeseries without having to use grafana anyone?)
* Administration (a green house or lab involves more than one user often)
* Logic ui (a.k.a. advanced interoperablity) a.k.a. "Swarms"
